If Container is Up so application is assumed to be up 
this doesn't necessarily mean application is working as expected 

Hence we use LivenessProbe in such cases 
---> Periodic tests to check container is actuall healthy
---> If fails container is destryed and restarted 

It is upto app developer to decide what constitutes healthy

LivenessProbe probe is added to Pod spec

livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /api/healthy
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 10 ## optional, just to give warm up time before probe 
  periodSeconds: 5 ## optional , timedelay between successvie probes
  failureThreshod: 8 ## No of attempts before Probe is stopped , default is 3 attempts


livenessProbe:
  tcpSocket:
    port: 8080

livenessProbe:
  exec:
    command:  ## array of cammands 
    - cat 
    - /app/is_healthy
