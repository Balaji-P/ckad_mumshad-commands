Pod Conditions

they complement Pod Status 
It is an Array of true/false Values that tells state of Pods

Some Pod Conditions --> PodScheduled , Initialized, ContainersReady, Ready

Kubectl describe pod <name> | grep -A10 -i Conditions

We need to tie the ready state to the actual  state of the application

An App developer what makes an app ready , and use combination of following features to arrvie at conclusion
These all together constitute readines Probes 
1. Http Probes for Webserver
2. Tcp socket listening in case of database
3. Custom script in container which exits denoting that application is ready 

In container spec add following --> Ready Condition is not set until Probe passes 

readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /api/ready
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 10 ## optional, just to give warm up time before probe 
  periodSeconds: 5 ## optional , timedelay between successvie probes
  failureThreshod: 8 ## No of attempts before Probe is stopped , default is 3 attempts

readinessProbe:
  tcpSocket:
    port: 3306 

readinessProbe:
  exec:
    command:
      - cat               ##  This takes options in array format 
      - /app/is_ready     ##


These readiness Probe allow them to applied to application only if they are ready and hence
allow smooth transition when pods are created / deleted
