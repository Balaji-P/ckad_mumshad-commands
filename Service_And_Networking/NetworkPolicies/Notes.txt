There are 2 type of Traffic Ingress and Egress 

This type is defined as per the entity/componet  concerned in question 

In incoming request will be ingress for recieving entity and egress sending entity

K8s is by Default All Allow in terms of Network Security WITHIN THE CLUSTER
Hence all pods can reach each other using Ips or Pod names or services configured for that purpose 

Network Policy is like  a k8s Object attached to ONE/MORE  PODS
  --> This is done using label and selectors 
  --> Label the pods 
      labels:
        role: db 
  --> Use the same in PodSelector of Network Policy
      podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          role: db 
  --> You can specify ingress and egress both in Network Policy
