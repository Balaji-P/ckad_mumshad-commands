FAQ - What is the rewrite-target option?

Different ingress controllers have different options that can be used to customise the way it works. 
NGINX Ingress controller has many options that can be seen here.

Without the rewrite-target option, this is what would happen:

http://<ingress-service>:<ingress-port>/watch --> http://<watch-service>:<port>/watch
http://<ingress-service>:<ingress-port>/wear --> http://<wear-service>:<port>/wear

To fix that we want to "ReWrite" the URL when the request is passed on to the watch 
or wear applications. We don't want to pass in the same path that user typed in. 
So we specify the rewrite-target option. 
This rewrites the URL by replacing whatever is under rules->http->paths->path
which happens to be /pay in this case with the value in rewrite-target. 
This works just like a search and replace function.
