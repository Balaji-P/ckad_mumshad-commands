How many attempts did it take to complete a Job?

Run the command 'kubectl describe job throw-dice-job' and add Succeeded and Failed counts.

kubectl create job <job-name> --image <image_name> --dry-run=client -o yaml > job.yaml 

kubectl create cronjob <name> --image <image_name> --schedule "30 21 * * *  "  --dry-run=client -o yaml > job.yaml
