Read Volumes_Notes.txt 1st

PVC are done to make the storage got from PV  available to a  node

administrator creates a set of PVs and customers create PVCs 

There is one to one mapping between claim and volume 

Every PVC is bound to a single PV , k8s tries to find a PV that has sufficient capacity 
as requested by the claim 

If there are multiple possible Claims to PVs , then you can use labels and selectors to 
bind to a right volume 

When PVC is deleted what happens to underlying PV can be configured
by default it is Reatin , or it can be set to Delete or Recycled 

Recycled -> scrub of prev data and make PV available again
