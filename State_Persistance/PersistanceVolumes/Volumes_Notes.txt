To Persist Data Processed by Containers we attach a volume to Containers,
So Data is Persisted even if Pod is ephemeral 

Volume and Mounts 

A Volume can be configured in different ways , like a directory on the host (host here is node )
Once a volume is created we mount the volume to a directory inside the container using volumeMounts
so as per below data-volume will be mounted at /opt inside container 

volumes:
- name: data-volume
  hostpath:
     path: /data
     type: Directory

volumeMounts:
- mountPath: /opt
  name: data-volume

There various ways to configure volumes on the host , the above hostpath
approach doesn't work in case of multinode cluster, since pods will assume /data path on all nodes to be same

There are several types of storage solutions such as NFS, ceph , s3 , ...

Many of these storage solutions are supported as well exp Amazon EBS.

volumes:
- name: data-volume
  awsElasticBlockStore:
    volumeID: <volume-id>
    fsType: ext4
