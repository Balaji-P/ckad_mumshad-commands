As name suggests you would like to select Nodes 

Like a  Pod with Heavy requirement is assigned to beefier Nodes 

apiVersion: 
kind: Pod
metadata:
    name: myapp-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: data-processor
    image: data-processor
  nodeSelector:
    size: Large 

Where did this size Come from? key value pairs  (size,Large) are labels assigned to Node 

How to add Label Nodes ?

kubectl label nodes <node-name>  <label-key>=<label-val>
Ex: kubectl label node  node01 size=Large 

IMP BELOW 
nodeSelector Limitations ?
--> We use single label and selector to achieve our goal 
Like requirement place pod on (Large OR Medium) nodes , or place pods (Not SMALL) this can't be achived via 
nodeSelectors
