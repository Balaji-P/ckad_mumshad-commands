// command ps aux -->  All the processes running 

Docker by default runs the processes as root user within  the container AS WELL AS  THE HOST 
  
Docker conat can only see process running inside it 

You can specfiy proccess to run as different user by specifying the userid  
docker run --user=1000 ubuntu sleep 3600 

OR Do the Above in DockerFile
FROM ubuntu 
USER 1000 

The image created from above DockerFile will run any command with user Id 1000


Ques 
What happens when you run Docker Containers as root user , is root user withing the contianer same
as the root user in the host ? Can proccess inside the container can do anything as root user inside  
host system ?

Docker implements security features that limit the capablites of root user within the container, like 
BROADCAST, NET_ADMIN , SYS_ADMIN , MAC_ADMIN ... etc 

You can  use " cap-add / cap-drop " options add privileges to root user in container 

docker run  --cap-drop KILL ubuntu(image)  --> Drop KILL permission 
docker run  --cap-drop MAC_ADMIN  ubuntu(image)  --> Add Mac admin  permission 

To allow all privileges Use following command
docker run --privilege ubuntu
