NodeAffinity provides advanced capabiliies to limit Pod Placement on Specific Nodes 

Below is example of NodeAffinity to Place pods on Large Nodes as shown in nodeSelector

apiVersion: 
kind: Pod
metadata:
    name: myapp-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: data-processor
    image: data-processor
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      requireDuringSchedulingIgnoreDuringExecution:
         nodeSelectorTerms:
         - matchExpressions:
           - key: size
             operator: In
             values:
             - Large 

You can multiple values like Medium, Small 
values
- Large
- Medium
- Small

operator can take other Values like "NotIn"  / "Exists" 

The type of NodeAffinity affects the Scheduler behavior 

1. requireDuringSchedulingIgnoreDuringExecution 
2. preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoreDuringExecution 
3. requiredDuringDchedulingRequiredDuringExecution 
    --> Will be added in Future  both required means pod will be evicted 

required is like compulsory Node Qualification and preferred is like try best fit Node 
Ignored is like it wont afffect Pods once they are schedduled and lables on Nodes are changed
