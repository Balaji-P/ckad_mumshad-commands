Do multicontainer Practise Exercie again

Sometimes you need some containers to work together (scale up and down together)

They share same namespace hence can refer to each other as localhost 
Have Access to same Storage Volumes

There are different patterns with multicontainer pods 
--> Sidecar , Adapter , Ambassador 

Sidecar Pattern Example -> Webserve container along with logging agent container

Adapter Pattern Example -->
Different Pods genrating different logging formats, use Adapter container to convet logs to same format before
sending to Loggign server 

Ambassador Pattern Example -->
Application communicates to different database instances depending upon env (dev/test/prod)
depending on env you need to modify connectiviy in application code , 
this logic in code can be outsourced to seperate container in your pod , to which app container can refer
to as localhost and can proxy the call depending on env.
